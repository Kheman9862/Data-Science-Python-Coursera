# Data-Science-Python-Coursera

This is the Data Science course which is completed using python. In this course i have learned how to deal with the data which can be in any format for example csv,excel,xml,html. I have learned how to clean, filter, analyze and manipulate the data by using two powerful libraries that are pandas and numpy.

These assignments will help in practicing pandas and helping you understand how a raw data can be converted into a useful data.
